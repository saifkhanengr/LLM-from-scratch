        "In this article, we will go through all the math and code from scratch of a Large Language Model (specifically DeepSeek V3). We will also train our own model, **ChatSPE**, on a small dataset and chat with it. This training of a model from scratch is called pre-training. Before diving in, please note that this article is intended for readers who are familiar (not expert) with programming and have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts (activation functions, cost functions, neural networks, etc.). We will use Python and PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is what will be covered in this writing (with math and code):\n",
        "### Here is the big picture of LLM:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text to Token IDs:**\n",
        "   *  Example: \"I love AI!\" → [1, 2, 3, 0]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Token IDs to Token Embeddings:**\n",
        "   *  Token IDs are just random numbers; they don't capture meaning.\n",
        "   *  Embeddings turn Token IDs into meaningful vectors, where similar words get nearby values, e.g., man ≈ 1.0, king ≈ 1.1 (same gender), while woman ≈ -1.0, queen ≈ -1.1 (opposite of male gender). In short, embeddings represent the meaning of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Token Embeddings to Q, K, V:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *  Embeddings capture the meanings of words, but the model needs to determine how each word relates to other words in the sentence.\n",
        "    *  This is done by projecting (linear transformation of) embeddings into Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *  For example, in the sentence: *Sarah visits the bank to deposit money while Zarah visits the bank to sit by the water.*\n",
        "\n",
        "        *  **Query (Q):** Represents a specific word (e.g., bank) and asks how it relates to other words in the sentence. Is it a financial institution or a river?\n",
        "\n",
        "        *  **Key (K):** Represents all words in the sentence and is used to measure the relevance (attention score) of each word to the Query. So, \"bank\" (financial) will get a high attention score when Q is \"Sarah\".\n",
        "\n",
        "        *  **Value (V):** Contains the actual information of each word and provides the final contextual meaning. So, the word \"bank\" near \"Sarah\" means a financial institute rather than a river bank.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Positional Encodings (RoPE):**\n",
        "   *  The embeddings don't know where in the sequence the token (word) appears\n",
        "   *  Without position info, **The cat chased the dog** would look the same as **The dog chased the cat.**\n",
        "   * So we inject positional information. DeepSeek used Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) only for Q and K.\n",

It also includes `use_cache` and `past_key_values` for faster inference, and an `attention_mask` to properly handle padding and causality (so the model ignores padded and future tokens). If you are not familiar with these terms, read a quick explanation below:\n",

For instance, first the model outputs two words, “The cat”, then we ask it for the next word (third word); setting `use_cache = True` makes the model store the computations for “The cat” inside `past_key_values` so it does not recompute them.\n",

However, in practice, LLMs such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek are trained with much larger model configurations on millions of books and other large-scale internet data. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 were trained for roughly 58 days on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for one or less than two epochs."
